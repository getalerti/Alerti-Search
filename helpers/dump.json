  "description": "We are a community of 30 million who think—and feel—differently about investing. Together, we’re changing the way the world invests.\n\nSince our founding in 1975, helping investors achieve their goals has been our main reason for existence. At Vanguard, we’re built differently. Vanguard is investor-owned, meaning the fund shareholders own the funds, which in turn own Vanguard. When you’re surrounded by people who care about the same things, things tend to fall into place.\n\nWith no other parties to answer to and therefore no conflicting loyalties, we make every decision—including keeping investing costs as low as possible—with your needs in mind. Because of our unique structure, your goals align with our goals. Whether you’re investing for your first house, college for your kids, or a comfortable retirement, you can be confident we’re on your side. That’s the value \nof ownership!\n\nCommunity guidelines: vgi.vg/sgl1",
