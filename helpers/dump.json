If a person who had worked for years in the US health care system had trouble navigating the world of long term care, I knew people without my experience must be having an even harder time.\r\n\r\neCare Diary is designed not just to be a website but also a community which provides comprehensive long term care information,  tools and resources to help people seeking and providing long term care.  Our unique feature is our Care Diary which is a set of online tools designed to make coordination of care and sharing of information amongst family members and other care givers easy.  The Care Diary gives multiple people access to the care recipient‚Äôs medical appointments, medications schedule, home care visits and other important items.  We also have a comprehensive database of nursing home and home care services, guides on long term care financing and information on important health care documents everyone should have.\r\n\r\nAs you deal with providing long term care for yourself or a loved one, I hope eCare Diary will be able to simplify the situation by providing you with the tools and information you need.\r\n\r\nJohn Mills\r\nFounder and CEO\n    5877 Commerce Street,  Pittsburgh, PA 15206, US",

  "description": "ObvioHealth is a global digital health organization providing real-world digital clinical trials that deliver better data.\n\nOur mobile clinical study application allows for site-less trial design, allowing subjects to use their smartphones to participate in remote monitoring clinical trials from the comfort of their homes. For studies designed to include site visits, our application allows for continuous data collection in between visits to the clinic.\n\nBy bringing the trial directly to the mobile device of each participant, our study team engages subjects daily using text message and chatbot features. This interaction allows for open communication and helps subjects feel involved during virtual clinical trials.\n\nThe result: robust data collection, increased compliance, faster recruitment and improved time to completion.\n\nTo assist with collecting real world data in clinical trials, our app can easy link to various health devices. They include Apple watches, Fitbits and activity trackers, along with Bluetooth scales, blood pressure monitors, and smart health apps.\n\nParticipants can also use the app to schedule lab visits, or connect it with their PayPal account to receive compensation for decentralized clinical trials. And if the study team needs to talk with the participant during mobile clinical trials, the app allows for easy communication through chat or video.\n\nVisit Obviohealth.com to learn more about how our technology can help with observational clinical trials and virtual clinical trials.",

The service benefits from low cost, excellent exchange rates and, in most cases, no international transfer fees. \r\n\r\nThe Uni-Pay service is delivered through a secure web portal that has two distinct component parts. These are an account management portal for the educational institution and a separate payment portal for the students. Both are linked together in the background to provide a single overall solution for the processing of student payments.\r\n\r\nWhat are the benefits of Uni-Pay?\r\n\r\nUni-Pay can virtually eliminate the costs associated with receiving international bank transfers or credit card payments being applied to educational institutions. \r\nWhat's more, the student will benefit from preferential exchange rates, meaning that the amount they pay in their local currency will be significantly lower than it is through the standard banking and credit card channels - reducing the cost to the student as well as the educational institution.\n    Unit 2, Olympic Way, Birchwood, Warrington, Cheshire WA2 0YL, GB",

The platform‚Äôs architecture is fundamentally different from legacy EDC and EHR, and was designed from the ground up, to specifically avoid the baked-in flaws of those systems.

We sacrificed what most people consider as some of the best years of their life. We‚Äôve put in passion and energy into creating something magical with a totally new approach.\nAs a result, we had the entire World‚Äôs leading tech media impressed by the magic and simplicity of our WALTR. It was a solution previously not found anywhere else. \n\nWe then started getting our first users who immediately supported us and followed us as if it‚Äôs some cult. If you knew about WALTR, then that‚Äôs the only option you‚Äôd recommend when someone finds it difficult adding music or video to their phone.\nSo what has changed?\nNothing. \n\nWe never lost focus on what made us stand out. In everything we did, we made it different and we made it simple. \n\nThat‚Äôs what our core, loyal customers love us for. We must deliver this in anything else we create. And we do. \n\nWe dedicate our products to those who value time & hate frustration. We dedicate our apps to You. ‚ù§\n    Ajeltake Road, 3, Majuro, MH 9696, MH",

IP networks, now, are the foundations for a new generation of services and connectivity. The whole infrastructure is becoming virtual, smaller, shorter lived and more dynamic. As a result, the number of network connections requested is massively increasing, placing unprecedented stress on data networks and network equipment.\r\n\r\nVolta Networks is about to change all this. With the Volta Networks solution, customers will now be able to purchase commercially available low cost, high performance switch hardware known as white box switching. This is made possible by the Volta Networks Control Platform software, running either on the customer‚Äôs private cloud, or on the Public or Hybrid cloud. This enables customers to build large networking infrastructures that provide unparalleled levels of flexibility and scalability. Our customers can ride the wave of network forwarding platform enhancements, while maintaining a stable and robust software infrastructure, independent of the networking hardware itself.\r\n\r\nOur approach allows us to dramatically cut the capital cost for network operators while also reducing their operating costs for things like software upgrades.  We also help speed the time to value for new services.\n      Boston, MA  US",

  "description": "Funambol is the leading provider of white-label digital lifestyle personal cloud solutions for mobile operators, device manufacturers, content providers and other companies that want to offer a personal cloud service to customers. The company's flagship solution, OneMediaHub, stores pictures, videos, music, files, contacts and calendars on smartphones, tablets and computers in the cloud, syncs them across devices, and allows sharing with other people and systems.\r\n\r\nIn contrast to other personal cloud services, OneMediaHub differs in four important respects:\r\n1) as a white-label solution, it enables companies to go to market with their brand, and their users to store their data and content in the provider's cloud, conferring revenue and loyalty/retention benefits to the provider\r\n2) it offers the most comprehensive capabilities and supports more types of data and content on more devices\r\n3) it is highly flexible, enabling providers to differentiate, and allowing integration with billing & support systems\r\n4) it can be hosted in the cloud for a provider for rapid time-to-market or deployed on their premises\r\n\r\nOneMediaHub has been deployed by many of the largest companies in mobile.

The approach is user-centric, with an emphasis on health and psychological considerations as much as financial concerns. We find that users will provide all the necessary information for a full financial planning fact find - voluntarily and at their own pace - when they feel they are intimately involved in the entire process. Most of our research has been focused on the psychology of user engagement through a partnership with leading academics. The tool personality profiles users to help frame suggestions in the language they will be comfortable hearing. We work in partnership with our clients to introduce products and education at the right time, in the right way, to each user in a personalised manner. We also provide our clients with access to a portal to track users progress and interact with them through email templates.\n\nThe tool introduces the idea of human capital and why life insurance is important, as well as taking an academic approach to risk profiling using techniques developed for the Big 5 Inventory personality trait model. The calculation engine combines goals, choices and Monte Carlo simulations to show what retirement could look like for the user, provides a Retirement Check-up document and allows for ongoing engagement through email/SMS/chat support.\n\n      Singapore,   SG",

  "description": "SMACC - Automatisiertes Finanzwesen durch K√ºnstliche Intelligenz\n\n\nBuchhaltung ist f√ºr jedes Unternehmen essentiell. Aus diesem Grund hat SMACC eine L√∂sung f√ºr Unternehmen entwickelt, die automatisierte Buchhaltung durch K√ºnstliche Intelligenz erm√∂glicht. \n\nIn unserem Kontext bedeutet K√ºnstliche Intelligenz, die F√§higkeit eines Software-Programms aus bekannten Regeln zu lernen (zu generalisieren) und das Gelernte ohne menschliche Unterst√ºtzung auf neue Sachverhalte anzuwenden. Die Technologie, die das erm√∂glicht, basiert auf k√ºnstlichen neuronalen Netzen, die auch bei selbstfahrenden Autos und in der Krebsfr√ºherkennung angewandt werden. Mit dieser Technik k√∂nnen T√§tigkeiten der Buchhaltung wie z.B. das Erfassen von Rechnungsinformationen, Kontierungen oder auch der Bankabgleich automatisiert werden und erm√∂glichen so maximale Effizienz.\n\nSeit der Gr√ºndung im Jahr 2015, ist das komplement√§re und internationale Team schnell gewachsen und vereint nun mehr als 60 clevere Informatiker, Wirtschaftsfachleute und Buchhalter. Die Gr√ºnder, Dr. Ulrich Erxleben und Janosch Novak, sind erfolgreiche Entrepreneurs und haben zuvor bei renommierten Unternehmen wie McKinsey, der Deutschen Bank und Rocket Internet gearbeitet. Auch unsere Investoren sind namhafte Venture Capital Firmen wie z.B. Cherry Ventures und Global Founders Capital.\n\nWenn du Lust hast, gemeinsam mit uns das verstaubte Image der Buchhaltung zu revolutionieren und Finanzprozesse zeitsparend, kosteneffektiv, und zuverl√§ssig zu gestalten, dann werde auch du Teil unseres erstklassigen Teams.

The main feature of our solutions is automated monitoring and analysis of human behavior in real time. This is possible thanks to key technologies - AI and Computer Vision.\n\nWhat are these solutions and what problems do we solve?\n\nProctor AI\nOnline proctoring service - allows you to automatically record violations in the process of passing an exam or testing. It doesn‚Äôt matter, there 100 people on the exam or 1k and it doesn‚Äôt matter where they are. The main thing is a stable internet connection and connected webcam.\n\nNeural network algorithms analyze human behavior and record the vast majority of violations (dozens of types and hundreds of their variations).\n\nAs a result, the customer receives a combined video with user identification and detailed analytical report of human behavior with markup on the video. The system analyzes both the physical behavior (looking away from the screen, voice sounds, the presence of unauthorized persons), and actions with the computer (window change, screen or audio channel sharing). \n\nBut if someone‚Äôs life depends on the result of the exam, we cannot allow the AI ‚Äã‚Äãto decide its fate. Therefore, we have developed a proctoring service by people (proctors)- post-viewing video or exam control in real-time. Proctors review records and adjust the report made by neutral network. Adjusted reports are given back for training the neural network.\n\nExamus EQ\nA system for monitoring human attention and involvement. It processes videostream from the computer's or phone camera and transfers analytics to the server. Thus, the customer receives real-time analytics of human / audience behavior while watching training videos or during participation in a webinar.\nAn important feature is that it processes data directly on the client device, which minimizes the cost of computing resources and excludes the transfer of person data.\n    2150 Shattuck Ave, PH, Berkeley, California 94704, US",

But the brain is one area where real innovation is sorely needed. The inability to accurately measure brain function hinders the management of injuries like concussions, disorders like chronic pain and the discovery for effective therapies for Alzheimer's disease or depression. Importantly, it prevents us from taking ownership of our own brain‚Äôs health. \n\nElminda is breaking those barriers with BNA‚Ñ¢ (Brain Network Analytics) technology, an electro-physiology based functional brain mapping, imaging and monitoring technology that finally allows medical professionals as well as patients and their families to SEE more, KNOW more and DO more, inspiring a revolutionary path to better brain health and creation of new standards for the assessment and treatment of brain related disorders. \n\nElminda has spent a decade pioneering a fusion of big data analytics, artificial intelligence and brain network analytics mapping that can quantify function and dysfunction, disease progression, and therapeutic effects in cases of  neurological and psychiatric disorders such as depression or pain. \n\nBNA‚Ñ¢ was cleared by the FDA and CE Mark and is available for commercial and clinical use in the US, EU as well as in Israel. Elminda is a revenue stage company with a unique business model combining a medical device and high margin cloud-based Software as a Service (SaaS).

During that time we witnessed how brands and manufacturers hit the same walls over and over again. Inspired to bring down the communication barriers we created Sewport. It is a unique space where Brands can effectively turn their passion into products, while service providers only get targeted orders and no time-wasters‚Äù - Boris Hodakels, founder of Sewport.\n\nSewport offers smart project development tools for brands and targeted business for the manufacturers. Both experienced fashion brands and newcomers without any links to the apparel industry benefit from a question guided enquiry process. The functionality of the platform ensures that each Brand‚Äôs project provides full details that best describe the scope of work they require.¬†\n\nWe hope that this modern solution to clothing manufacturing process will inspire more people to start and scale their own clothing lines.¬†\n\nSEWPORT - CONNECTING BRANDS WITH CLOTHING MANUFACTURERS\n\n    21 Ellis street,  LONDON, London SW1X 9AL, GB",

Put simply, we are experts in web-application vulnerability remediation as a service. \n\nWEB-DEFENCE: RedShield redefines what a web-app protection service should do. We are the world‚Äôs first web-application defence system to be targeting 100% vulnerability mitigation. This impressive goal can only be achieved using our advanced shielding technology, allowing us to create designer shields for every application vulnerability found. As more and more attacks are being launched every day, it is virtually impossible to be able to ‚Äò100% protect you.'‚Äã What we do instead is attempt to shield and deflect every attack against every vulnerability found in your systems. \n\nZERO TOUCH: All of this is achieved without a single update to your back-end code. Simply pass your web-traffic through RedShield, and our team of global security experts will break down and analyse every vulnerability scan and pen-test result found. Our systems will then provide and deploy the necessary shields. If your issue is truly unique then our 24x7x365 expert defence teams will tailor the shield(s) your applications needs, and not only the technical flaws, but we can also shield logic flaws too. \n\nINSIDE AND OUT: We can also shield web-apps via our global RedShield Cloud or even your internal apps with our RedShield Private Nodes. In short, we provide all the systems and expertise to make it work.\n\nIf you're web-apps are vulnerable and hard and slow to fix, then you need to see if shielding is an option for you now.

  "description": "Two thirds of supply chain planning across the globe is still being done using spreadsheets. Such dependency on manual work hinders the sharing of insights across different departments. This, in turn, slows down organizations‚Äô ability and agility to respond to customer needs. \n\nOrganizations who are looking to reduce the dependency on manual work typically invest in traditional ERP systems. These ERP systems may provide the basic logic behind planning and forecasting. However, the increasingly complex and uncertain business world demands much more than that.\n\nNow more than ever, businesses need to think about digital transformation and automation. \n\nSolvoyo is the true enabler of digital transformation. Our cloud based SaaS platform uses advanced analytics and artificial intelligence to optimize and automate decision making in supply chain planning. \n\nOur all-in-one platform forecasts demand, optimizes inventory, plans production, replenishes networks and concurrently optimizes fulfillment and transportation plans; eliminating silos while reducing the dependency on manual work.\n\nThe scalability, analytical capabilities and short implementation cycles of our cloud platform help our clients achieve dramatic improvements.  Solvoyo has over 40 successful deployments around the world, leading to significant and measurable outcomes for Fortune 100 CPG and Retail customers.

  "description": "Cloudphysician is a healthtech company that is transforming the delivery of critical care. Cloudphysician uses its proprietary technology platform, RADAR, to connect command centers staffed with trained critical care personnel to ICUs remotely. These specialists use RADAR to monitor and manage patients 24/7, thereby improving the quality of care.\n\nRADAR digitizes and analyses patient data in real time using computer vision, Natural Language Processing and provides clinical decision support to super specialist doctors at the command center who then recommend the appropriate treatment that needs to be directed to patients at ICUs connected to RADAR. Inbuilt in RADAR are diagnostic tools to assist doctors and automated early warnings that alert caregivers. This allows one doctor to monitor multiple patients at any given time, no matter the location - thereby addressing the quality of care, shortage of specialist doctors and improving outcomes of critically ill patients (measured by decrease in mortality rates, reduced complications, enhanced medication safety).\n\nShortage of trained medical personnel is a universal problem, and this shortage is particularly acute in India. It is known that critically ill patients require specialized care and access to an Intensivist improves patient outcomes. Cloudphysician's RADAR solution, designed for low resource settings, enables specialized doctors to leverage technology to increase access to quality ICU care. Given where many of these patients are located, they would not have otherwise had access to specialized doctors.\n\nAt Cloudphysician, we enhance the delivery of critical care services via adoption of smart-ICUs. This has resulted in improved patient satisfaction and operational efficiency of hospital ICUs. To learn more visit us at www.cloudphysician.net. If you are a hospital and would like to engage, write to info@cloudphysician.net.\n\nWe are hiring!

  "description": "Dispatch is the modern field service experience platform, purpose-built to solve the communication gap between enterprise brands, 3rd-party contractors, and the consumer. Most brands rely on independent local partners to deliver the on-demand expertise required for local installation, repair, support or maintenance services, leaving the customer experience and brand's reputation at risk. Today's consumer expects a transparent and effortless service experience and judges brands on their ability to meet that expectation. Dispatch powers modern service by seamlessly connecting brands to an army of expert-on-demand local contractors, providing those contractors an intuitive platform to assign and manage jobs, and communicating service details automatically to the customer via their mobile device. When coupled with a CRM or existing field service management software, Dispatch automatically synchronizes customer, performance and job data between systems. Ultimately, Dispatch links the people, process, and data to create a modern service experience that delights customers, empowers contractors, and promotes a positive brand image for the enterprise.\n    123 N.

A health system typically spends tens of millions on equipment purchases and rentals annually. However, average utilization of 42% means most capacity remains idle. One hospital‚Äôs new spinal surgical table may gather dust, while a nearby facility cancels procedures due to equipment issues ‚Äì or sends patients away altogether.\r\n\r\nOur solution combines a technology platform, analytics, and supporting logistics to make medical equipment available ‚Äì anywhere and anytime ‚Äì on-demand. Some call our approach the sharing economy or collaborative consumption.

  "description": "Our mission is to build technology for material hauling that optimizes the way material producers, haulers, and field crews collaborate.\n\nBefore HaulHub was born in 2015, founder and CEO Joe Spinelli operated his own heavy construction company. He ran it for nearly two decades, growing the business through the economic downturn by taking lean measures. As the construction industry‚Äôs demand for trucks increased, he continued to focus on improving operations and doing more with less.\n\nTo meet the growing demand for trucks, Joe and his team prototyped an internal automated tool to find and schedule trucks. This was the seed for HaulHub. Word about the new system spread among the close-knit construction community. Contractors and drivers alike hopped onboard.\n\nIn the spring of 2017, HaulHub took a major leap forward to see how its automated solution could help with the operations of one of the largest material producers in the Northeast. HaulHub has since grown to power over 1,000 plants and jobsites and we support some of the largest material producers and contractors in the industry. The solutions are more advanced and the business issues are more complex, but the premise is unchanged: run lean operations by doing more with less.\n    120 St James Ave,  Boston, Massachusetts 02116, US",
