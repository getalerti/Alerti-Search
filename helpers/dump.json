Therefore we have developed an AI\nProcess Automation for Enterprise Business Communication\n(support, supply chain, HR, finance,...) via Slack/Teams/E-Mail/Voice/...\nthat automates Communication and Databases for enterprise\ncustomers/employees to save time, cost and boost\ncustomer/employee satisfaction.”\n\nWhy we are different\nState of the Art for automation companies was the static anthology approach which needs human interaction to grow with companies over time for helping them to automate business processes. We go one step further. We dynamically automate up to 80% of business processes in real-time. Our patented genetic coding system enables continuous learning with constant improvement in quality and accuracy of automation.\n\nAPA Technology\nWe have developed a patented novel NLU architecture built upon an in- depth analysis of text structure using recent breakthrough in computer linguistics, and a set of self-organized ML approaches (supervised/unsupervised, reinforcement, etc). To get best of both NLP and ML we implemented automatic source code generation, based on rethought genetic algorithm.\n\nMission & Vision\nWe have been working on AI products since 2015 to help people to focus on the important things in life. So we decided to help enterprises managing successfully their transition to the “Empathy Economy” via our AI Process Automation.\n\nWe believe that in the years to come 85% of repetitive actions in enterprises will be handled by machines and that we are one of the leading companies that are shaping this near future.\n\nPeople & Culture\nWe are driven by technology but we understand that great technology is only built by great teams of people so we believe in\n\n- People & Culture\n- Communication\n- Execution\n\n\n    W Jefferson Blvd,  Los Angeles, California  US",

Customers are most excited after they buy so they check tracking 3.1 times. If you’re shipping 10,000 packages that’s 30,000 brand impressions. Most brands are sending that traffic to UPS or Fedex, handing it off to a third party and disrupting the customer's branded experience. \n\nIt's never been more difficult to get and retain customer attention, so every touchpoint with a customer matters. We give you the control to turn the typically stale and confusing experience of shipping into an opportunity to drive customer engagement while the customer is most receptive to your brand. \n    719 Virginia Ave, Suite 101, Indianapolis, Indiana 46203, US",

The result was the creation of Five Points Healthcare; a company that possesses industry leading experience yet maintains a small-company feel that is committed to its five key stakeholders – Patients – Employees – Physicians – Providers – Communities.\n\nFive Points Healthcare believes that most people prefer to receive care at home whenever possible and patients deserve high-quality options which will allow them to remain independent in the comfort of their own homes.

Having help available at the press of a button is not only reassuring to staff it could potentially prevent serious emergencies or additional liability from occurring in the first place.\n\nThe React Mobile platform utilizes both GPS geolocation and blue tooth beacon technology to provide unparalleled accuracy to locate an employee in distress. Their technology works both on and off the hotel property and is equally applicable to a large distributed resort-style property as it is to a multi-story hotel tower. Inside of a building, the React Platform uses blue tooth beacon technology to pinpoint the exact location of a distress call. Outside of the building the system reverts to GPS coordinates and can follow an incident in progress in real-time relaying up to the second location information. \n\nThe React Mobile solution is also able to leverage existing technologies that a hotel may already have in place to provide an elegant and robust safety platform at the lowest cost possible. For example, many of their customers use some form of housekeeping software like Amadeus HotSoS. The React Mobile software can pull room location information in from integrations with these types of software and further reduce the cost of deploying a robust employee safety solution.\n    720 Seneca St,  Seattle, Washington  US",

We want to make sure their co-workers and management teams know their value.\n\nWe simplify the process of buying professional services allowing for repeatability and scale.\n\nOur vision is that buying and selling professional services will be as easy as shopping on Amazon, standardizing the service sales process allowing for repeatability and scale. Over the last decade, we’ve seen an explosion in SaaS software, a proliferation of on-demand services and the development of marketplaces that connect buyers and sellers. These trends are set to accelerate, now that automation and AI are transforming how we work and transact.\n\nWe break down the silos creating harmony between sales, professional services, and their clients.\n\nServices are hard to standardize. This results in confusion between teams, unnecessary customization, over commitment, and impactful misunderstandings. By normalizing service offerings, adding governance, and collecting insights into the service sales process, teams create stronger alignment and a more successful, streamlined sales approach.\n    356 New York Ave,  Huntington, NY 11743, US",

Data is siloed making it difficult to understand what’s going on inside applications and infrastructure. The result is often a poor customer experience and wasted engineering time tracking down incidents. Oh, and it costs a fortune.\n\nObserve discerns why applications and infrastructure are running the way they are from the data they emit. We enable engineers to spend more time coding features and less time investigating incidents. We reduce outages and issues with customer experience.

  "description": "ZenBusiness is a trusted partner for business owners who want to start, run, and grow a business. We use technology and automation to provide fast and low-cost services, expert support, and a personalized dashboard that puts everything you need at your fingertips.\n\nWe became a Public Benefit Corporation because we want to give back and revolutionize the process of forming a business so that more people can realize their dreams and boost our economy in the process. One way we do that is via our “Pay-It-Forward” project with Kiva.org, a nonprofit that connects people through lending to alleviate poverty. We randomly select women-owned and minority-owned businesses in the US to loan money to each year, helping more aspiring business owners manifest their dreams and welcoming them into our business community.\n\nOf course, a business is made of more than its owners, and happy employees lead to happy customers. That’s why we invest in our employees by providing them with health insurance, competitive salaries, equity, and the opportunity to tackle interesting challenges that have a positive impact. Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have been a remote-first company. \n\nZenBusiness is democratizing the entire process of forming a business. Becoming an entrepreneur is stressful and intimidating, especially for marginalized communities who in year’s past didn't have access to tools like those of today’s leading companies. Previously, aspiring small business owners would need to do research, hire a lawyer, find the right accountant, buy a domain name, hire a web designer, and more before they could even start thinking about selling their product or service. With ZenBusiness, small business owners can do all of that in one place. \n    5511 Parkcrest Dr,  Suite 103, Austin, Texas 78731, US",

As the only open and hardware-independent solution, Plume enables the rapid delivery of new services for connected homes, small business, and beyond at massive scale. For residential subscribers, Plume delivers self-optimizing WiFi, cyber-security, access controls, and more. Our purpose-built suite of smart services turns small business networks into fully connected, business intelligence platforms.

And to help you fill the spaces that matter to you with all kinds of wonderful.\n\nWith a bias for action and love for breaking molds, the team at Plume embodies a combination of relentless curiosity and imaginative innovation. We constantly challenge ourselves to think in ways that other companies don't, and work to do what should be done (rather than what can). It’s how we've assembled a team of world-class engineers, thinkers, and doers. And it’s how we’re reinventing what’s possible every day.\n\nWe believe that the core competitive advantage in the over-the-top era resides in the ability to create new services at high cadence, deploy them at massive scale, and to orchestrate through a common data set.

  "description": "In a world moving at an incredibly fast pace, businesses have grown accustomed to change. Transforming their business model, pivoting their strategy, rethinking their go-to-market, the list goes on.\n\nTo enable these changes, they have also had to rethink the way they work. \nBreaking down silos isn’t a best practice anymore. It’s a given.\n\nAnd yet, when it comes to planning, little has changed. In fact, planning tools work the exact opposite way, reinforcing data and people silos, and preventing teams from working together toward their common goals.\n\nAs a result, planning is usually seen as a dreadful process. \nBut the truth is, planning drives strategy. It’s high time we serve it with the right tools.\n\nPigment is the business planning platform for fast-growing companies. Our mission is to help companies make better, faster decisions in a changing world, and drive revenue growth.\nAt Pigment we believe that:\n\n✅ Real-time data informs better outcomes. Trim your sail, and make the best use of current winds.\n\n✅ Reporting should be accurate, quick, and insightful.\n\n✅ Planning should be simple, smooth, and delightful.\n\n✅ Less time should be spent on data crunching, more time on bringing insights to the business.\n\n✅ Collaboration should be at the heart of any planning process, so your organization works as one.\n\nBook your demo today 👉 https://www.gopigment.com/contact\n\nWe’re hiring!

However, as companies use more and more SaaS applications to collaborate, organizational knowledge becomes increasingly difficult to retrieve effectively. The knowledge essentially gets thrown out, when it is spread across Slack conversations, Google Docs, Email, Github, Wikis, and more. This forces engineers to resolve problems that already have solutions, or interrupt their co-workers for information.\n\nLandria helps engineers find knowledge from their existing data sources and from other engineers within their organization. When an engineer isn’t able to find what she is looking for, Landria will connect her to the appropriate person within the organization and naturally translate their interaction into maintainable documentation that will be discoverable for reuse.

Partnering with north-end minister, Apostle Wadie Lanier, and working out of her New Temple of God community church, the program prospered. It was the first “after-school” tutoring program in the area. \r\nThe “4-Walls” Project, partnering with the African American Environmentalist Association, and its founder and executive director, Norris McDonald, is a 4-year pilot program with five levels of assessment and evaluation. It is first a tutoring program for low income students who are experiencing difficulty with academic achievement and social interaction leading potentially to truancy or dropping-out of school altogether. Many of the students will be from single parent, grandparent or guardian homes with contact to local or state social services including foster care. The Project, held after-school, on (M,T,W) and on Saturdays, provides a minimum of 15 hours per week, over the four (4) days, tutoring in core subject areas (the 3-R’s), combined with a specialized focus in “building/ sustainability.” Saturday workshops will be devoted to “hands-on” work, plus monthly trips to topic-related sites. Program participants must be fully enrolled students, from any Manchester high school (private or public), who desire to improve their individual test scores and GPA (2.0 or lower) by one full point or more over the four years, thereby gaining confidence in their own abilities to graduate, and leading to either post high school education or gainful employment.",

  "description": "Leaders rely on information from their frontline and are constantly gathering data. One-on-ones. Meetings. Emails. Surveys. Spreadsheets. Texts. Town halls. Some methods, like one-one-ones, yield very high-fidelity insights but they’re too time consuming to scale. The methods that do scale, like surveys and spreadsheets, do so at the expense of quality. So, leaders end up using 4, 5, 6 methods at any one time. \n\nThe result is ad-hoc data collection chaos. Data is everywhere and nowhere. Lost. Forgotten. Late. And underutilized.\n\nUntil now.\n\nGroopit replaces the chaos of ad-hoc data collection. It’s the ultimate way to get, share, and use intelligence from your frontline and empower everyone involved with real-time data to problem solve and ultimately, accelerate results. We call it #crowdsolving.\n\nWith Groopit you can:\n\n•\tGet precisely the right data.\n•\tFocus everyone on your top priority. \n•\tThree taps to turn anecdotes into quantitative data.\n•\tEmpower everyone with real-time visibility.  \n•\tAccess and integrate data into existing enterprise systems. \n\n\nThe problems you face as a leader may be difficult and complicated to solve, but the tools you rely on to help solve them shouldn’t be. And that’s part of what makes Groopit such a game-changer: it’s a lightweight solution that fuels lasting success. Whether fifteen or five hundred people are involved, Groopit gives leaders the tools they need to get, share, and use data from the frontline, so they can tackle their most challenging problems and amplify their greatest successes. \n\nVisit our website to learn more.\n\n    918 S Horton St, #818, Seattle, Washington 98134, US",

  "description": "We built Maxwell to change the game for small and midsize mortgage lenders — whether you originate $300M or $3B. Today our digital mortgage platform powers hundreds of mortgage lending institutions nationwide, from non-depository mortgage banks, to credit unions, to brokers, to community banks. We work to make them, and their employees, the real heroes who enable homeowners to achieve the American Dream. And we’re just getting started.\n\nMaxwell was founded in 2015 by homebuyers who were shocked by the complexity of the mortgage process for borrowers and lending teams alike. Somehow, in the mix of paperwork, points and process, the humanity and emotion of the largest financing decision of a person’s life had been lost. After spending a year with over 1,000 mortgage professionals, the founding team realized we needed to focus on making the people who make a difference really shine. Now, we employ a world-class team of software experts and mortgage professionals who pull up our socks every morning to do just that. We’re privileged that our company has been recognized by HousingWire, Progress in Lending, MReport, and others as a leading innovator in our industry.  At the end of the day, we are a committed team doing honest work that really matters in the real world — one lender, one borrower, one homeowner at a time. And it works.\n      Denver, Colorado  US\n  \n      Minneapolis, MN  US\n  \n      Raleigh-Durham, NC  US\n  \n      Dallas, TX  US",

Today our design tool has attracted over 60 million happy users across 190 countries, who have collectively created more than 7 billion designs. \n\nWith an integrated marketplace that has both free and paid stock photography, fonts, illustrations, and thousands of templates; a paid subscription that offers the ability to set up a brand kit so users can save their brand colours, fonts and assets, and ensure consistency across their designs; and a print service that gives our users the ability to produce professional prints in a variety of formats and sizes, delivered straight to their doorstep - Canva is disrupting the way we design.",

  "description": "Kobiton is how companies make their mobile apps work better everywhere. The problem with traditional approaches to mobile testing is that you can never keep up. There’s always another device, another operating system, another page of the app that you just don’t have time to test. To make your app work better everywhere, you’ve got to go faster (with scriptless automation), go flexible (with more deployment options), and go forward (with continuous innovation) – and only Kobiton brings this “go, go, go” approach to mobile testing. Using real devices and next-gen automation, you can test your app in a fraction of the time it would normally take. The result: impeccable mobile experiences across more devices, operating systems, and use cases. That’s why so many companies from IBM to Coca-Cola to Uber already rely on Kobiton for mobile testing. And it’s how organizations like yours can now deliver new releases ten times faster. \n\nKobiton | Make it better everywhere™\n\nTry Kobiton for free: https://goo.gl/VFdpgn\n    1776 Peachtree Street NW, 200N, Atlanta, GA 30309, US",

With StormSensor, it’s finally possible to adaptively plan for and manage urban flooding, greatly mitigating hazardous risks and reducing costly cleanups and property damage. \n\nWith a fully scalable sensor network and real-time visibility into our sewer systems, StormSensor has changed the way cities track and manage urban flooding, ultimately saving each community millions of dollars annually. \n\nAnd that means we meet our bold mission of using data to build innovative, resilient communities: an urgent and necessary step in changing how we manage flooding and wastewater, an old industry that impacts literally every person on the planet.\n    505 Broadway East, Ste 115,  Seattle, Washington 98102, US\n  \n    3100 Airport Way S,  Seattle, Washington  US",

  "description": "TaxJar is on a mission to reimagine the sales tax experience for online businesses of every size. With best-in-class technology and support, we simplify the complexities of sales tax through automation. Over 20,000 companies rely on TaxJar to stay compliant. \n\nReady to automate your sales tax compliance? Contact sales at taxjar.com/request-demo.\n\nWe were founded to help eCommerce merchants spend less time on sales tax and more time growing the businesses they love. We’re passionate about creating simple solutions and leveraging technology to solve complicated sales tax issues.\n\nWe’re a 100% remote team that knows first-hand the sales tax challenges we’re working to resolve. We're lean, but experienced. We've started our own businesses, sold successful companies (a few in the tax and accounting space), been part of IPO's, worked at fortune 500s and have even resold hundreds of designer shoes on eBay from the garage. We get it. Sales tax isn't fun and that's why we made TaxJar. \n\nWe all work remotely from wherever we work best for each team member. For most of us, that's home. For others, that may be a local coffee shop or a summer vacation house. The only requirement is that we're working from a place with WiFi, and we're able to get our work done. We talk all day over Basecamp and each of our teams have separate rooms to discuss what's necessary.\n\nWe’re a happy TaxJar team and we all really love what we do. We've created a space where high-achievers can succeed, but are also safe to fail. We're profitable and focused on growing TaxJar sustainably. We're always learning how to make TaxJar the best place to work for all of us, and not just another tech start-up. We’re always looking for an amazing new teammates to come share in the excitement of solving real-world problems with technology.... and we're hiring! \n\nLearn more about us at www.TaxJar.com/jobs!\n      Boston, MA 02116, US",

Our sellers enjoy a safe, fast way of auctioning high-value items to a market of committed buyers, ultimately selling at the best market value. By providing easily, accessible & guaranteed item descriptions,  buyers enjoy a steady influx of deals suited to their business needs.\n\nHow It Works:\nDescribe: A seller submits a description & image of their valuable online. Based on this description, we use our smart technology to conduct a market value analysis.\n\nShip: Worthy will provide a prepaid FedEx shipping label for insured overnight shipment to our secure facilities. Once the valuable arrives at our headquarters, we professionally photograph it and hand deliver it to GIA for grading.\n\nGet Offers & Get Paid: The valuable is put up for auction where targeted buyers will compete for it. Once a seller approves the final bid, payment is processed almost immediately and we send the valuable to the winning buyer.\n\nWorthy transactions are entirely guaranteed – no fine print or cancellation policies. Once a seller approves the highest bid, money is transferred and the deal is sealed. We professionally authenticate and describe valuables, assuring buyers that what they bid on is exactly what they’ll get. In turn, we pre-screen all buyers, dismissing fraud or trust elements found in non-secured marketplaces.\n\nHeadquartered in Manhattan, Worthy is regulated by the NYC Dept. of Consumer Affairs and the BBB. We are proud partners of Hanover Insurance, FedEx and ParcelPro, assuring that all shipments to and from Worthy facilities are secured.\n    20 W 37th St,  New York,  10018, US\n  \n         US",

Better writing. From our CEO to the latest writer to join our community. We’re obsessed with two things - overperforming for our clients and making sure we have fun doing it!\n\nWith 10+ years of experience in content writing and content marketing, six consecutive Mercury 100 Awards for Fastest Growing Private Companies in Colorado, a colorful brand, and a powerhouse team of creative people, Verblio is poised for world domination (the friendly kind).

  "description": "Companies and individuals are using more and more cloud-based and hosted apps. You’ve got G Suite, Slack, Salesforce, Dropbox. The list goes on. On average, companies use 88 apps to power daily workflows, a 21% increase from three years ago. This means that knowledge (a company’s core IP) is fragmented across organizations, slowing down search, performance, productivity and complicating compliance issues. So why don’t people and organizations have a way of creating one single source of truth to give them control over their knowledge and enable them to do more with it?\n\nOnna integrates workplace knowledge platforms together, allowing anyone to - for the first time - unify, protect, search, automate and build on top of an organization’s proprietary knowledge. It doesn’t matter if companies are integrating knowledge from 20 applications or 200. They can also build on top of Onna through integrations to cloud tools or the addition of ML models. Finally, Onna uses machine learning to help companies discover smarter and can help power data-led automation on issues from compliance to HR. What does that mean simply?\n\nPossibilities for enterprises using a Knowledge Integration Platform like Onna include eDiscovery, information governance, enterprise search, archiving, compliance with data protection laws like GDPR and FINRA, monitoring for leaks of confidential data and building bespoke internal workflow apps using proprietary information. For small businesses, using Onna can drive individual and team productivity by reducing time wasted looking for information.\n\nWith headquarters based in New York City & Barcelona and offices in Raleigh & Toulouse, we’re working with some of the world’s most sophisticated companies, including Facebook, Electronic Arts, Fitbit, and Dropbox. It has also raised a total of $43M from investors including Atomico, Dawn Capital, Dropbox, and Slack Fund, and by 2025, will be the core of any individual or company’s knowledge infrastructure.",

LeadIQ eliminates the most annoying parts of prospecting,  helping sales reps get new deals with less work. \n\nThe average sales rep only spends 1/4 of their time actually prospecting. That's because reps spend their days looking up prospects in Salesforce, researching them on the web, finding lead contact info, and doing manual data entry. That's not why you hired your sales team, it's not why they work in sales, and it just isn't a good use of anyone's time. \n\nWith millions of emails, phone numbers,  titles, and accounts, our prospecting platform makes it easy  to focus on your pitch and build relationships, without sacrificing a clean Salesforce.

Delivered as SaaS, Orca Security’s patent-pending SideScanning™ technology reads your cloud configuration and workloads’ runtime block storage out-of-band, detecting vulnerabilities, malware, misconfigurations, lateral movement risk, weak and leaked passwords, and unsecured PII.

From a companywide perspective, our goal is to create a positive impact on our people and planet.\n\n\nOur shared truckload solution, FlockDirect, drives these goals forward by setting a new standard of service for shippers, increasing revenue for carriers, and reducing the environmental impact of freight shipping. Our internal Impact teams drive these goals forward by holding us accountable and measuring our progress in areas like:\n— Philanthropy\n\n— Community engagement\n\n— Employee engagement\n\n— Diversity and inclusion\n\n\nBacking from investors like SoftBank, Volvo Group Venture Capital, Susquehanna, Eden Capital, SignalFire, GV (formerly Google Ventures), and GLP Capital Partners tells us these goals are worthwhile. \n\n\nIt’s not just our investors who see the Flock Freight vision; in 2021, CNBC named us to their Disruptor 50 list and Fast Company named shared truckload to their World Changing Ideas list. Our team is working to change the world for the better, and these awards tell us we’re on the right track.\n    701 S Coast Hwy 101,  Encinitas, California 92024, US",
