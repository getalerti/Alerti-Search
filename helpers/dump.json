  "description": "goDeskless is a cloud-based workforce automation platform specially designed for the \"deskless workforce\" - your frontline field champions that interface with your customers and prospects.\n \nThe deskless workers often work in disconnected mode, and depend on the office-based CRM users for critical customer information. Lack of access to right information creates operational inefficiencies. The dependency on CRM creates customer experience friction with the three-way communication challenges between the customer, the CRM user, and the deskless worker, and results into significant revenue loss.\n \nWe solve these challenges by automating enterprise field operations in disconnected mode so the deskless workers always have access to local data to function regardless of connectivity, and using AI to connect consumers to the deskless workers without CRM intervention or dependency.  \n \nOur AI-powered OnDemand Service Platform transforms enterprise data into Fast Data, and combines it with engaging experience. This allows workers to better utilize information and consistently achieve higher efficiencies in deskless mode.\n \nWe sell white-label ready smart-apps designed to work on smart phones and tablets for both consumers, as well as deskless workers.  We provide a consumer facing app for our customers' end users, and a field workforce management app for our customers' field workers.\n \nThe consumers request service through our app, and are automatically connected with the best available deskless worker. The consumer engages directly with the deskless worker while the CRM user takes a back seat and monitors. This experience is similar to the popular shared economy platforms that automate OnDemand Service Delivery (food, appliance, travel, etc).\n \nWe charge per monthly active user per month that connects to our platform. We monetize by selling our platform through Retail (Direct sale to enterprises), Wholesale (via resellers/partners), and White-l",

  "description": "Founded in April 2013 and based in Potsdam near Berlin, Germany, Snaptrust specializes in the creation, recognition and verification of anti-counterfeiting markers. Backed by years of experience in image processing on mobile devices, company founder and general manager Cüneyt Göktekin has invented and patented more than 17 products and systems. One of the unique features of Snaptrust technology is that it is invisible to the human eye and can be detected/authenticated using a smartphone.\r\n\r\nThe Snaptrust marker can be applied on a variety of products without special machinery or production line modifications. This makes the technology cost-effective and easy to integrate into existing systems. No need for additional coatings or printing plates. The marker can be conveniently uploaded to designated production sites via Internet.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nAuthenticity is verified via smartphone. This keeps the tamper-proof marking confidential and eliminates the need to reveal it to line employees.\r\n\r\nThe patented Snaptrust system uses micro­scopic markers applied on the product surface. Complex interpolation and image processing algorithms recognize and verify these markers. This makes it possible to conceal several bytes of data (serial numbers, product information, etc.) in a single marker. Recognition and authentication takes place in real time on an offline mobile device. \r\n\r\nSnaptrust technology can be implemented across many different industries, from luxury goods and cosmetics, to tobacco and replacement parts.\r\n\r\nSnaptrust is licensing it's technology to leading international brand owners.\n    Friedrich-Ebert-Str. 84,  Potsdam, Brandenburg 14467, DE",

We empower a learn-by-doing approach and eliminate the frustration of downloading and configuring new software that often pushes new learners away. \n\nWe maximize professional and technical preparation by delivering foundational content within the practical, project-based context of a simulated work environment. As a result, students graduate with the skills they need to be desirable in the job market and begin adding value from their first day of hire. Pathstream’s learners not only create a portfolio of projects that demonstrates their skills, but also ultimately earn certifications from the higher ed institution as well as the relevant software platform company, ensuring their efforts translate into actual career mobility. \n    Shaw Alley,  San Francisco, California 94105, US",

Using our cutting-edge machine learning algorithms, retailers and brands are ditching conventional sizing solutions and leveraging our technology to reduce returns and increase conversions. Ultimately, our goal is to revolutionize the apparel industry by leveraging this data to unlock body-relative apparel design.\n\nHistorically, apparel sizes have been generated in the absence of customer-driven body data. This has led to a worldwide apparel waste problem caused by a high rate of returns coupled with a bad consumer experience around fit and sizing, often amplified online.

  "description": "Building the future of e-commerce.\r\n\r\nWe work with the leading brands to unite their products with influential online stores. This new paradigm in online sales is called ‘e-commerce distribution’.\r\n\r\nOur network of stores influences hundreds of millions of customers on a daily basis. These stores establish a targeted customer base and are desperately looking for more quality products to offer their audience. We unite brands with this network of established online retailers and watch the synergies grow both businesses.\r\n\r\nOur software has been launched into 3 Shopify apps for independent e-commerce retailers.\r\n\r\n1.       Vault Drop is a supplier that provides affordable US-manufactured and distributed jewelry with high-margin potential. They offer plenty of options from earrings to necklaces and bracelets. \r\n\r\n2.       Air Waves OnDemand offers on-demand custom-printed apparel in a wonderful variety of styles and prices. They provide the quickest turnaround and highest quality printing available. \r\n\r\n3.       FiberFix offers an innovative new product that replaces glue, duct tape and epoxy in a hardware drawer. They experienced great success on Shark Tank and are now offering their flagship product to sell through online stores, in the coming months they will be adding other innovative products, many of which were featured on Shark Tank as well.\r\n\r\nOne of the biggest drawbacks of dropshipping is finding, contacting, and connecting with suppliers. It can become costly and time-consuming. Our software solution solves that problem by adding your online store to our current network of over 300,000 stores! You gain access to products from leading brands and the ability to automate the processing, fulfillment and billing of those same products.

  "description": "VibeCatch is an advanced employee engagement platform that utilizes frequent pulse polls and analytics to help companies build better culture and improve their bottom line. It is the only employee engagement tool that leverages the effective Quality of Work Life (QWL) Index, created by professor Marko Kesti, a leading academic specializing in HRM performance.\n\nThe QWL Index uses unique job satisfaction metrics that highlight specific areas of improvement within the organization, by pinpointing weak signals and undercurrents that most survey methods fail to detect. Through automated polls collecting relevant feedback, leadership can easily shift focus from measuring job satisfaction to actually improving it.\n\nWith the scientifically-backed QWL framework, companies can even link employee engagement to productivity and financial results, giving them the opportunity to find what areas would benefit the most from developmental investments.\n\nVibeCatch is a subscription based service with prices starting at $2700 per year including all features and online support targeted at companies with 100 employees and below. If you have over 100 employees please contact us to get an offer.\n    Fredrikinkatu 34 b, 26, Helsinki, Southern Finland 00100, FI",

ECaTS is the first universal 911 Call Reporting System that leverages the ubiquitous nature of the Internet to provide secure, real-time reporting to the 911 industry.\r\n\r\nECaTS was originally developed by Direct Technology, a custom software development and hosting company back in 1997. Originally, the service was developed to solve a critical business need for the 911 Program Office in the State of California. The Program Office was seeking a solution that could provide universal 911 Call Statistics Analysis across the entire State, regardless of the type of Customer Premise Equipment (CPE) installed at each Public Safety Answering Point (PSAP). \r\n\r\nDirect Technology decided to accept the challenge. They developed and deployed the first version of the service in late 1997 and the result was an overwhelming success. ECaTS was the first service to abstract the complexity of collecting, reporting and managing 911 Call Statistics using a web browser and some creative technology.\r\n\r\nThe ECaTS MIS service has since been successfully deployed in a myriad of States and Counties. Its new version of the service embraces solid Business Intelligence and Collaboration features that are increasing the demand for the company's services across the industry. Thee ECaTS portfolio of services has grown to include Text To 911 reporting, Dashboard Monitor & Response, Data Migration, and Wireless Routing Analysis\n    3009 Douglas Blvd., Suite 300, Roseville, California 95661, US",

  "description": "Proxistore®  is the complete web-to-store solution for merchants,shops, store chains… \r\nIt is an excellent solution to increase your traffic significantly and acquire new customers at your point of sale thanks to local -based online advertising. \r\n\r\nHow?\r\n\r\nEven when you buy in a local shop, you need good information on the Internet. Possibly you already saw the very local and targeted advertisements on the web sites of De Standaard, RTL, La Libre, Knack and others: internet advertising guiding the consumer to the local shop. Local advertising with good information quality exists and works, Proxistore®  confirms!\r\n\r\nWhy?\r\n\r\nEven after more than ten years of e-commerce many goods are not bought online. The Internet is a very important source of information leading to a purchase in the physical shop. Hence, merchants and store chains have a clear interest in very targeted local quality ads.\r\n\r\nTechnically?\r\n\r\nThanks to Proxistore®  you can address your advertisement to surfers within your communication zone. Proxistore can reach 7 out of 10 people in your selected zone.\r\n\r\nTo do so, Proxistore® uses a patented geolocated procedure (n° PCT/EP2012/070789). To obtain the exact location of every surfer and guarantee accuracy, the geolocation is organized on different levels. Every procedure is accepted by the laws on privacy.\n    Rue Emile Franqui 4,,  Mont-Saint-Guibert,  1435, BE",

We asked for 10 quotes from different providers but only six of them got back to us within a week. On top of that, the prices went up to €12,000. The providers gave us bad service and high prices.\n\nWe decided to do something about it. We decided to specialize in the production of animated explainer and e-learning videos. With smart knowledge transfer and a streamlined production process we are able to provide high-quality videos at a low cost and quickly. Great for us. Even better for you.\n\nWe have grown rapidly and have established ourselves as one of the best in the industry. And we are still growing.

  "description": "Determining accurate cost basis has traditionally been a frustrating challenge for investors, tax professionals, advisors and institutions alike. Trying to identify and account for corporate actions that affect cost basis can take hours, days or even longer, depending on the complexity surrounding a security and the length of the holding period. Fortunately, there’s an easier solution – NetBasis. \r\n\r\nNetBasis provides accurate adjusted cost basis information in seconds. Drawing on a securities database extending back as far as 1925, it instantly accounts for historical pricing changes caused by stock splits, corporate mergers, dividend reinvestments and other events. \r\n\r\nWith the enactment of strict new reporting regulations, cost basis accuracy has never been more important. Whether you’re looking to prepare Schedule D forms, calculate adjusted cost basis for 1099 reporting, determine the adjusted cost basis of inherited or gifted securities, or verify capital gains taxes, you’ll appreciate the precision – and efficiency – of NetBasis. It’s the same technology the IRS used to audit capital gains returns for its 2005 Tax Gap Report.\n    1661 East Camelback Road, Suite 200, Phoenix, AZ 85016, US",

It can be used by anyone who has to manage a case, run an investigation or incident. \n\nEvidence Manager (EM) allows you to record all evidence from recovery through to destruction.  Accessible via the Cloud, details of evidence recorded within EM can be viewed by stakeholders regardless of their location.  The solution also incorporates a fully auditable electronic chain of custody component, so you know where evidence is located and who has possession.  It also has a few extra tricks up its sleeve, which we can discuss should you be interested in knowing more.\n\nOur cloud-based technology is developed by British software professionals, as well as ex-law enforcement and ex-Government agency personnel .  \n\nOur solutions are not industry restrictive and will benefit anyone who has to manage investigations, cases or evidence that may include law enforcement, corporate security professionals, brand protection specialists, H&S, HR and Incident Response.",

Key features of the platform include:\n-- Leading edge security profiles based on government and industry standards (CIS, DISA & NIST STIGs, PCI-DSS, HIPAA, FFIEC, FISMA, etc.)\n-- Automatic integration and application of security profiles, so that cloud apps can be deployed quickly, cost-effectively, and without human error\n-- Application of security profiles across clouds, enabling consistent and continuous protection\n-- One-touch security compliance through IT service catalog tools like HP Cloud Service Automation, enabling both skilled and novice users to protect enterprise data\n-- Integration into DevOps, enabling flexible security throughout application lifecycles \n\nFor more information, please email us at info@cloudraxak.com, or visit our website and download our free guide to Securing Applications in the Cloud: https://www.cloudraxak.com/resource/\n    1484 Pollard Rd #363,  Los Gatos, CA 95032, US",

Het is één lange keten van gebeurtenissen, beslissingen en acties.

Onze software verbindt deze verdeelde informatie aan elkaar. Zaken worden in plaats en tijd gekoppeld en in de juiste context geplaatst, zodat men verborgen conflicten en vereiste acties in beeld heeft. Een straatevenement en werken aan een gasleiding gaat bijvoorbeeld niet samen, maar ze hebben allebei een vergunning nodig.

  "description": "In a space that is often ignored, EvoEco is creating a set of Smart Waste Bins to empower enterprises'​ sustainability efforts, while also reducing their bottom line waste costs. Because of the high cost of landfill, our Smart Bins use a multitude of sensors and interactive displays to help consumers divert their garbage from landfill into more cost-effective and environmentally friendly alternatives, like recycling and compost. Our intelligent monitoring system also allows for the bins to monitor how full they are, and notify service personnel when they need to be emptied. Additionally, we host a suite of internal tools that enable enterprises to gather analytics on where their customers are throwing items away and how much they are depositing at a given location. These analytics allow businesses to better understand consumer behavior, and optimize their operations accordingly, saving them both time and money.\n    EvoEco, 1100 NE Campus Pkway, Suite 200, Seattle, WA 98195, US",

The acquisition advanced Accelya’s vision to provide a next-generation, end-to-end platform that enables airline commerce, providing a full suite of innovative retailing, distribution and fulfillment solutions. \n\nFarelogix has played an instrumental role in defining innovative retailing for the airline industry, providing passenger service system (PSS)-agnostic technology that enables airlines to dynamically create, control, optimize, and deliver personalized and differentiated offers across sales channels. At the time of acquisition, Farelogix had more than 25 airline customers worldwide using its technology to grow revenue per passenger, achieve greater efficiency, and reduce costs. Integration with Accelya’s complementary mission-critical airline solutions optimizes the entire airline commerce lifecycle by allowing greater control and flexibility over commercial offers, orders and downstream processes, and benefiting airline customers and their passengers through accelerated digital transformation.\n\nThe acquisition followed Vista Equity Partners´ investment in Accelya by the firm’s first permanent capital investment fund, Vista Equity Partners Perennial. Perennial’s investment and operating experts partner with leading and mission-critical enterprise software businesses seeking to advance their market leadership and product innovation. The Perennial strategy is differentiated by its permanent capital structure, which allows it to engage in value creation opportunities and provide capital and expertise to accelerate company success over decades. \n\n\n    760 NW 107 Ave., Suite 300, Miami, FL 33172, US",

  "description": "KnoxMediaHub (KMH) is a SaaS Cloud Platform specifically built for the Media and Entertainment (M&E) Industry. \nOur Vision is that the Global M&E Industry will be completely Cloud-based by 2025. Players who fail to integrate the Cloud as the foundation of their businesses will disappear from the market.\n\nWhy is Cloud SaaS becoming critical for the M&E Industry?\nBecause Production and Post-production Studios and Distribution Platforms face increasing challenges to remain viable in the Digital Age. Two of these challenges are:\nComplexity: operating in this Industry is becoming more and more complex, as Content must be produced and simultaneously delivered in multiple standards and definitions on all sorts of devices. More complexity means more cost if nothing else changes.\nDecreasing Margins: the value-chain of the Industry is losing the \"fat\" of the old times, due to fundamental changes in the Industry structure and to the disruptive impact of Digital and the Internet, which enable new Busines Models quickly replacing old ones. And, it's just the beginning.\nThese two challenges are opposed to each other and represent a lethal mismatch that needs to be addressed at a Strategic level by established Companies.\n\nHow does KMH help Companies face such challenges and succeed?\nBy bringing Cloud-based SaaS Video Solutions to them and making them extremely easy to embrace. With them, Clients dramatically improve their Business by increasing Sales, Quality of Service and Margins by reducing Opex and Capex. KMH takes care of all operations and executes them unmanned where resources are unlimited and (orders of magnitude) more affordable. This simplifies our Clients' organizations and lets them become leaner.\nKMH connects the industry in a collaborative space where content does not need to move but can be processed, edited, encoded and then exchanged with any global destination.\n\nContact us: we can get you started in minutes.\n    Carrer de Benet Mateu, 40,  Barcelona, Cataluña 08034, ES",

Our core product offering is Organic Response - a Distributed Intelligence lighting control system that allows each individual luminaire to make lighting decisions based on the presence of occupants in its immediate vicinity, ambient light levels, and information it receives from its neighbouring luminaires. It then contributes information back to the luminaire community, so other luminaires can also make more informed lighting decisions. \n\nAlthough they make decisions individually, Distributed Intelligence means all the lights in a defined space act as a coordinated whole.  The result is a highly flexible, energy efficient lighting control system with a compelling proposition to developers, building owners and tenants:\n\n* Organic Response is easy to install.  Because the control technology is integrated into light fittings before delivery to the building site, installation is as easy as installing a luminaire.  The system is completely Plug & Play, with no additional wiring or commissioning required for the system to operate.\n\n* Once installed, the system is simple to operate, with various control parameters adjustable using a simple smartphone app.\n\n* Organic Response has a rich feature set, delivering highly sophisticated lighting control through motion detection, daylight dimming, and scenes and zones functionality, amongst many others.\n\n* The system has been independently evaluated in multiple installations, showing energy savings of between 56% -78%.\n    2 Greenwood Street, Abbotsford, Melbourne, Victoria 3067, AU",

  "description": "We combine algorithms, natural language processing, phonetic similarity, and advanced search techniques to rate, rank, and visualize names that are the same or similar to yours — which could prevent you from building the brand you want.\n\nA pioneer in professional name creation, SB is known for her creative and strategic naming and brand architecture innovations; for the famous names her companies create; and most recently for her software spin-off, Naming Matters.\n\nFinding an ownable, defensible, and attractive name for a new company or product is always a challenge, a high-stake process for founders, investors, creative agencies, and enterprises. Creating names and evaluating them for availability (including the risk of being sued) has long remained the realm of founders struggling to do it themselves, creative agencies who do naming but not as their focus, and attorneys and branding consultants. Naming Matters aims to solve for this, a process that has barely changed in decades.\n\nNaming Matters automates expert naming and branding services, making name creation and decision-making instant, inexpensive, and accessible to everyone, everywhere, including for agencies, enterprises, law firms, and entrepreneurs. Our natural language processing for trademark class matching (over 14 million trademarks assessed), combined with our proprietary algorithmic scoring, allows us to visualize trademark availability vs. risk. Together these allow users with no knowledge of how trademarks work to eliminate their risky names, and quickly focus on their best name candidates.\n\nAt SB’s naming company Master-McNeil, she has been responsible for creating Concur, PayPal, Clarium, Affirm, Eos, Ariba, Borealis, Connexant, Quid, Schwab Signature, Netopia, Planet Labs, Athlon, Duron, Opteron, and Sempron (for AMD), over 60 Apple names, Pixo, LaCrosse, OneWorld, Navigant, Rendezvous, and hundreds more.\n\n\n    2117 A, Fourth Street,  Berkeley, California 94710, US",

  "description": "Veicoli nasce un paio di anni fa come progetto creato da 4 studenti dell’università degli studi di  Torino, diventato successivamente startup incubata presso “I3P-Incubatore Imprese Innovative del Politecnico di Torino” e tuttora una società costituita nel mese di Novembre 2014. Stiamo sviluppando due prodotti legati alla gestione dei mezzi su ruota: Veicoliapp e Veicoli for Business.\r\n\r\nIl nostro principale prodotto è Veicoliapp, un’app web e mobile che si occupa della gestione di: scadenze, costi, manutenzioni, tagliandi, cambio degli pneumatici, note, rifornimenti, consumi e molte altre funzioni inerenti a tutti i mezzi circolanti su strada. Abbiamo più di 40.000 utenti iscritti, di cui il 78% sono utenti attivi e usano il servizio. Il nostro punto di forza è la gestione sincronizzata tra piattaforma web, android e ios dell’utente: tramite un singolo account, l’utente può accedere da smartphone o web al suo profilo in quanto i dati non sono memorizzati sui dispositivi mobile ma sul server in cloud. Quest’ultima è stata una nostra scelta fin dall’inizio per garantire la sicurezza e l’integrità dei dati dei nostri utenti.\r\n\r\nIl nostro secondo prodotto è Veicoli for Business (online da pochi mesi), una piattaforma web dedicata esclusivamente ai professionisti di settore (centri revisione, officine, carrozzieri ed altri professionisti) tramite la quale il professionista può gestire i propri clienti, avvisarli nel momento in cui voglia effettuare delle promozioni tramite notifica push, email ed sms e sostituire completamente il sistema di avviso in prossimità di scadenze, fatto oggi in forma manuale e cartacea: il prodotto avviserà in modo automatico, tramite un algoritmo proprietario, i clienti del professionista tramite email e notifica push (per chi userà Veicoliapp) andando ad automatizzare il processo (il 90% dei professionisti spedisce ancora a mano la lettera per avvisare il cliente al momento della revisione) e andando così a ridurre lo spreco di carta e tempo\n    via pier carlo boggio, 59, presso I3P incubatore imprese innovative, Torino, TO 10138, IT",

Our vision is to be the gold standard broadcast platform enabling SMBs’ to broadcast their message in their own businesses, creating an open-exchange and local business networks around the world.\r\n\r\nEverywhere you look there are screens – from fast food chains to public transportation.  They are used for promotional info, ads, entertainment, news and more.  The budget for these digital signage signs is hundreds of thousands of dollars for infrastructure, creative, campaign and network management as well as broadcasting.  Despite the large budgets, the ROI is high because over 60% of people remember the content seen, and it increases “spontaneous buying” by 30% because of promotional awareness.  Not to mention the entertainment value that keeps customers happy.\r\n\r\nSMB’s, who also could greatly benefit from screens like these, simply can’t afford them.  If they choose to use a screen, they must make do with a closed-circuit computer screen with a running presentation, images or a streaming message.  This is not professional, not scalable or dynamic, with no real-time benefits and doesn’t allow for networking or interactive social activity.  The screen value is low because the content doesn’t engage customers.  In many places, like clinics, gas stations and elevators – there are captive audiences who would have no choice but to read the screens.  This opportunity is too good to be missed!  \r\n\r\nSign up for Novisign today!",

We interviewed every staff member from multiple dealerships including the Owner, Outside Salesperson, Inside Salesperson, Managers, Accountant, Service and Install Team. Using years'​ worth of their feedback we tailored a system around what their needs are. PATH | WD can be introduced to your staff without having to disrupt existing workflows, assisting every employee instead of burdening. \n\nPATH WD is an all-in-one software solution that takes all the inefficiencies inherent in running a dealership with multiple vendors, products, customers and employees and brings order, efficiency and results.

That is where Cirrus Identity comes in. We make secure, easy to integrate, cloud-hosted identity products to give those users easy access to internal enterprise services. \n\nThe Cirrus Gateway is our most popular tool, and enables easy integration of social identities, like Google, LinkedIn, and Facebook with enterprise Single Sign-On solutions. Our gateway is used by many universities and global research companies to allow parents, external research collaborators, prospective students, alumni, and others to access campus services and research projects using their existing social identities. \n\nThe Gateway eliminates the need for these external users to create new usernames and passwords, removing user frustration and common support tickets for forgotten usernames and passwords. \n\nThe Cirrus Account link service is all about making the connection between one user and multiple digital identities. If you provide an option to login with multiple social identities, people may forget WHICH social identity they have previously chosen. Our Account Link service helps make it easy to tag each social identity with a specific user so they can forget every time and never experience a challenging login process. \n\nWe have several more services to make access ridiculously easy for you external users. \n\nCommon Use Cases:\n\nUniversities: Alumni engagement, parent access to pay tuition, student applicants, continuing education students.\n\nGlobal Research Collaboration: Research projects that involve scientists and researchers around the globe\n\nEnterprise companies: External auditors and consultants that need access to company systems and information\n    Remote,  Oakland, CA 94602, US",

  "description": "Enapter is a rapidly-growing energy technology company based in Pisa, Italy with offices in Germany, Thailand, and Russia. We develop and produce Anion Exchange Membrane (AEM) electrolysers for green hydrogen production from water and renewable electricity, enabling low-cost green hydrogen production at any scale. Our patented and proven AEM technology is the foundation for mass-produced electrolyser products, not projects. We project they will make the cheapest hydrogen with scaled production, competing with fossil fuels purely on price.\n\nHydrogen is essential for the rapid decarbonisation of sectors that are reliant on liquid and gaseous fuel. Enapter’s mission is to make green hydrogen affordable and accessible to all. \n\nOur compact hydrogen generators can be deployed rapidly thanks to their modular, plug & play design and our Energy Management System Toolkit for simple software integration and remote control. Used by customers in 40 countries for energy storage, mobility, heat, industry, power-to-fuel and more, our electrolysers put affordable, highly-efficient green hydrogen generation in your hands. \n\nEnapter is preparing for mass fabrication with increased production capacity at our Italian facilities, as well as the expected completion and soft launch of our Enapter Campus automated mass-production site and R&D facilities in Saerbeck, Germany by 2023.The Campus is a blueprint that will pave the way for further AEM Electrolyser mass-production sites around the world: a decentralised network of factories that would bring the world gigawatts of green hydrogen production capacity and unlock the green hydrogen futures that are within our grasp.",

These systems and associated processes are time-consuming, often leaving no time for the most important part: Resident follow-up.\n\nServusConnect transforms these basic work order systems into a hi-fidelity, mobile-enabled maintenance operations platform. The result is greater efficiency of staff and vendors, richly documented repairs with time-stamped photos and comments, electronic vendor invoicing, and intuitive reporting that is easily consumed. \n\nServusConnect doesn't stop there. The system interactively engages  Residents via text messaging, notifying them of service completion, requesting feedback and, when the Resident is ecstatic, politely asks them to post a positive online review. The result is real-time Resident Satisfaction insights that help apartment operators address issues and get more positive online reviews.\n\nFor more information on ServusConnect, visit our website at www.servusconnect.com!\n    1 Floretta Place # 80504,  Raleigh, North Carolina 27623, US",
