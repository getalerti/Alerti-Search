  "description": "StorReduce is pioneering a virtualization layer containing numerous unique technologies for companies to move data to and better use it at scale on object storage and cloud. StorReduce's vision is to enable enterprises to have a single cloud data lake with no data silos, that is affordable, scalable and maximizes the data’s business value.\n\nOne technology in the StorReduce virtualization layer is software defined, scale-out deduplication with a cloud native interface. The only deduplication built for modern cloud object storage, StorReduce reduces object storage costs, speeds up transfer, by up to 97% and enables reuse of the data and metadata on object storage with generic cloud services. (See StorReduce Malware Detection demo at https://youtu.be/9_FNSqaNUDU.)\nA single StorReduce cluster can handle 10s to 100s of petabytes of data at extremely high throughputs and enables new business cases such as removing backup appliances and storing primary backups straight to object storage or cloud.\n \nOther technologies in the StorReduce layer include: Object Clone, Deduplicated Replication, StorReduce Insight and more. See storreduce.com for details.\n \nStorReduce was 1 of 4 partners worldwide for the AWS S3 Infrequent Access launch, 1 of 8 partners worldwide for the Google Cloud Coldline launch and was recommended by Gartner as a cloud deduplication software in their report: Market Guide for Data Center Backup Targets.\n \nStorReduce is in production around the globe and is recommended by most leading clouds and private object stores.\n\nStorReduce software installs on-premises or in your cloud or object store in minutes and is available for Free Trial by contacting StorReduce.\n    640 West California Avenue, Suite 210, Sunnyvale, CA 94086, US",

  "description": "Suvola is a cybersecurity company creating solutions for the three major shortcomings of current information technology systems in use today.  These three major shortcomings are in the areas of identity, tampering, and authentication and are responsible for the vast majority of cybercrime.\n\nIdentity management and protection of user credentials has been one of the biggest challenges in cybersecurity.  To address this, Suvola has developed the ambient identity device.  This advanced piece of identity technology can be embedded in everyday wearables and equipment to provide either primary or secondary verification of the identity of the user or equipment without the need for user names, passwords, PIN codes or other forms of user entry information based validation.  The Suvola ambient identity device complies with all industry standards  for identity and authentication devices and uses BLE technology for communications.  By using ambient identity devices, users can have a far more secure and trusted environment while also experiencing a far more convenient way of managing their identity online.\n\nTo address tampering, Suvola is creating a secure and trusted software platform to support a line of cloud infrastructure, web services and enterprise data management software for the enterprise information technology appliance market. Packaged and sold as self-contained rack-mountable devices for cloud or enterprise infrastructure, the Suvola tamper-proof computing platform addresses the need for more cost-effective, easier to manage information technology infrastructure to support tablet, mobile and the emerging Internet of Things applications with advanced security and trust.",

For Uplogix, evolving out-of-band means monitoring devices and taking actions directly over the console port, like an onsite technician plugging in a laptop. We go far beyond traditional “dumb” console servers that sit plugged in and waiting to be useful should there be a crisis.\r\n\r\nWe’ve deployed everywhere from the data centers of global financial institutions to remote energy production platforms to the battlefield, as well as the branch office down the street. The challenges we solve exist in all networks. In fact, our top three customers are all in different markets (federal, satellite and financial).\n    7600B N Capital of Texas Hwy, Ste 220, Austin, TX 78731, US",

  "description": "Cargosoft emerged as the result of the development of innovative ocean freight software for the forwarding company Karl Gross. With the collaboration of different institutes of the University of Bremen and a business consultancy, the software solution SeeSped was created in 1990. Modern software architecture in combination with customer-oriented service led to dynamic development for the company.\n\nIn 2007, due to the fast pace of development in the logistics market and growing expectations of global software, CargoSoft GmbH merged with DAKOSY AG, a company based in Hamburg. As a subsidiary of that company with actual 85 employees, CargoSoft offers future-oriented solutions from a single source and is acknowledged to be a leading provider of transport management solutions for international carriers and industrial companies.\n\nThe international successful e-Logistics branch solutions CargoSoft® has meantime been installed in over 400 businesses globally. Some reference customers from the project logistic perspective are Alexander Global, Deugro, LS International Cargo, Hansa-Meyer, Karl Gross as well as breakbulk terminals like the Wallmann terminal in Hamburg. In 2009, due to the heavy demand on the international market-place, CargoSoft Ltd opened another branch office in Singapore.\n\nThe continuing growth trend demonstrates one thing above all: that the company CargoSoft GmbH meets new challenges with a dynamic approach and is continually refining its services and solutions to meet the sector’s future demands. This way our customers always profit from individual, sustainable solutions tailor-made to fit their exact needs.\n\nThe Supply Chain Management Solution „CargoSoft Global Logistics Access (GLA)” provides all the relevant information for stakeholders in the transport process in a transparent way and “just in time”. Internet-based technologies visualize every single step of the transport process – from sourcing to the final distribution.\n    Buschhöhe 10,  Bremen, Bremen 28357, DE",

  "description": "Access simple and elegant -- but POWERFUL -- solutions for the most significant challenges of Internet Marketing\r\n\r\nAs youʼve probably noticed, marketing is rapidly moving online.\r\n\r\nSure, traditional marketing (print, TV, radio) isnʼt going to totally disappear, but itʼs quickly getting displaced by online marketing. For example:\r\n• The vast majority of people now search for a local business online rather than use the Yellow Pages\r\n• Most people now comparison shop online before making almost any purchase\r\n• Almost one in ten people on the planet are active users of one of the social networks\r\n• Every industry has a competitor thatʼs “crushing it” by using the Internet as their dominant means of marketing\r\n\r\nThis shift of marketing from offline to online is so recent and happening so fast that most businesses are struggling to keep up (or, worse, still trying to get started) -- especially given the growing complexity of what it takes to be successful.\r\n\r\nFor example, Internet Marketing used to mean just having a website - but, no longer. Now, it also requires the use of email autoresponders, social networking, online video/ audio, article distribution and much more.\r\n\r\nThe reality is that most business people have little interest in learning about this stuff -- but the Internet technologists donʼt seem to understand that. They continue to make totally unrealistic assumptions about what a businesses person can do, wants to do or has time to do with online marketing.\n    10532 N.

  "description": "Wenn „Digitalisierung“ auf Unternehmen trifft, zieht das nicht nur einen technologischen Wandel nach sich. Es bewirkt vor allem massive Veränderungen im Arbeitsalltag der einzelnen Mitarbeiter und im Zusammenspiel der Gesamtorganisation. contexxt.ai bereitet Organisationen und Mitarbeiter auf diese Veränderungen vor, begleitet sie hindurch und macht die Entwicklung messbar – mit datengestützter Analyse und methodischem Beratungsvorgehen.\n\nUnternehmen jeder Größenordnung stehen vor der unvermeidbaren Herausforderung, Arbeitsprozesse und Arbeitsplätze zu digitalisieren. New Work, Workplace 4.0 führen zu Veränderungen in den Arbeitsweisen, vor allem aber auch in der Zusammenarbeit. Diese Veränderungen haben große Potenziale, bringen aber auch entscheidende Herausforderungen mit sich – die Mitarbeiter müssen wollen, sonst sind alle Vorhaben von Anfang an zum Scheitern verurteilt.\n\nUnsere Coachingmandate helfen, die Digitalisierungsvorhaben strukturiert und zielgerichtet im Unternehmen zum Erfolg zu bringen. Klarer Fokus dabei ist es, messbare und belegbare Ergebnisse zu erzielen. Effiziente Workshopformate, etablierte und praxiserprobte Vorgehensweisen und nicht zuletzt effiziente Analysen und datengetriebene Erfolgsmessungen führen transparent zu schrittweisen Ergebnissen.\n\ncontexxt.ai hat es sich zur Aufgabe gemacht, den Nutzen von Technologien für den einzelnen Menschen in den Vordergrund zu stellen – um Motivation und Sinnhaftigkeit zu erhöhen und um die Eigenschaften, die Menschsein ausmachen, mehr in den Vordergrund der Arbeit zu stellen: Kreativität und Emotionalität. Denn für den Digitalisierungsprozess müssen unternehmensindividuelle Handlungsfelder und nutzenorientierte Lösungen definiert werden, die nicht nur an den Unternehmenszielen, sondern vor allem am Bedarf der Mitarbeiter sowie an der Unternehmenskultur ausgerichtet sind – nur so werden durch neue Arbeitsformen positive Effekte erzielt…",

The virtualization platform COQOS Hypervisor SDK integrates a mix of real-time applications and open source solutions on powerful domain controllers. For example, the hypervisor allows a cockpit controller to run AUTOSAR software next to a Linux and an Android guest. A Telematics Control Unit can integrate a FreeRTOS with two Linux guests, all running in separated virtual machines.   \n\nCOQOS Hypervisor SDK supports a large bundle of features corresponding to the virtualization standard VIRTIO, creating maximum flexibility: guest operating systems can be used and reused on different Systems on Chips. OpenSynergy cooperates with the primary Operating System (OS) providers to ensure that Android, AGL, AliOS, and other OS are entirely supported.\n\nCOQOS Micro SDK is the virtualization variant for microcontrollers, mainly used in the safety-critical real-time domain. Typical application domains are powertrain, chassis, body, gateway, and ADAS control units, which implies the separation kernel must achieve a high safety level of ASIL-D. \nThe automotive leading Bluetooth® stack Blue SDK is one of OpenSynergy's communications platforms. It is the reference Bluetooth® implementation for many OEMs around the world. The variant Blue SDK Fusion offers a reliable Automotive-Grade Bluetooth stack for Android™ Automotive OS. \n\nOpenSynergy further provides complimentary Automotive-Grade software components tailored for the Android Open Source Project (AOSP) to boost Android's adoption in the automotive domain.\n\nOpenSynergy also provides engineering services to support the customization of its products.\nRead more on www.opensynergy.com",

We partner with leading landlords unlocking benefits including positive yield from non-yielding areas and introduce accredited local urban farmers into turnkey modular operational controlled-environment vertical farms. \n\nLarge scale onsite food production on rooftops, unused space and carparks is supported by realtime reporting to stakeholders enabling co-ordinated and connected scaling across entire building portfolios. We are focused on solving the food security crisis, helping cities get to net zero and activating circular economic models. We drive changes in consumer food demand around freshness and nutrition, reducing waste and disrupting the supply chain with integrated edible green infrastructure, massively reducing our CO2 footprint and addressing the challenges of the climate crisis.\n \nOur focus is to transform the global food industry with disruptive turnkey food systems to support changes in consumer demand for less processed foods with more locally-sourced produce reducing transportation, food waste  and processing that contribute to greenhouse gas emissions,. The climate smart solution enables clients to activate complete circular economic models at scale, future-proofing building marketability and CSR through to greening work environments and on-site composting with positive social and environmental impact. It is more crucial now more than ever that onsite food production is needed to simplify supply chains and ensure reliable access to healthy, traceable food at a hyperlocal level.\n    80 Bay St,  Ultimo, New South Wales 2007, AU\n  \n    201 Sussex St,  Sydney, New South Wales 2000, AU",

It is expensive to find, recruit and train new employees - often costing 30-50% of the base salary. Everyone knows that employee referrals are the gold standard of recruitment, leading to quicker hires, better hires, and longer retention. But the mechanics of most company referral programs are cumbersome and ineffective.\r\n\r\nWhat if referrals could be made with a smartphone - using an app that displays both an employee's contacts and their company's job postings? \r\n\r\nWith JobShakers mobile app, a simple drag-and-drop is all it takes.

These correlations are driven by AI & ML algorithms plus your team’s and SignifAI’s collective expertise. This means your team can get to root causes quickly, regardless of the seniority of the engineers currently on shift. And because SignifAI is a machine, it has perfect memory. This means it can match the cause and resolution of an issue from the past, with an issue happening right now. These powerful correlations also unlock predictive insights to issues that could threaten uptime in the future.

  "description": "A TOPCHAMPS é uma plataforma de RH que faz a gestão de OKRs, avaliação de desempenho e remuneração estratégica.\n\n1) Gestão de OKRs:\nA metodologia de OKRs ou \"Objetivos e Resultados Chaves\"​ foi criada pela Intel, adotada pelo Google, Samsung, Disney, Microsoft, etc. Em função de sua eficiência muitas empresas no Brasil vem a aderindo metodologia que serve para eliminar a subjetividade das metas de cada cargo, atribuindo métricas numéricas (indicadores) para o alcance do objetivo. A plataforma permite um cascateamento dos indicadores da empresa e sua estratificação entre os departamentos e colaboradores. Também através da plataforma é possível fazer o acompanhamento dos indicadores da empresa, departamentos e colaboradores de maneira a facilitar a atuação dos gestores sobre os indicadores que estiverem abaixo da meta.\n\n2) Avaliações de Desempenho:\nAs avaliações de desempenho levam em consideração 2 aspectos:\n- Quantitativos: Expressos pelo alcance dos indicadores (vs metas) da empresa, departamentos e/ou colaboradores.\n- Qualitativos: Expressos pela aderência dos colaboradores às competências do cargo.\n\nO gestor de RH estabelece a periodicidade dessas avaliações e define o peso dos aspectos quantitativos e qualitativos assim como de cada indicador e competência. O gestor responsável pela avaliação poderá dar feedbacks através da plataforma para corrigir a conduta de sua equipe e melhorar esses indicadores e aderência às competências.\n\n3) Remuneração Estratégica:\n\nPor fim, as avaliações de desempenho podem ou não, estar atreladas à remuneração do colaborador. A meritocracia costuma gerar resultados impactantes na produtividade da empresa. A plataforma tem a opção de apresentar o bônus/PLR e comissões em tempo real que podem estar condicionadas ao alcance dos indicadores da empresa, departamentos e/ou colaboradores.\n\nA Topchamps promove a integração dos interesses de empregados e empregadores, para que todos sonhem juntos numa mesma direção.\n\nwww.topchamps.com. \n\n    Rua Joaquim Silva, 11 SL.907 - Glória,  Rio de Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro 20241-110, BR",

  "description": "Vertical Fox’s technology provides a paperless brokerage platform for employee benefit brokers and employers in the middle market.  Our platform empowers employers and brokers with faster results, more powerful insights and lower costs. This new paradigm utilizes real time data which allows brokers to gain efficiencies and streamline processes. Employers can make more informed and faster decisions with lower procurement costs and fees. \n\nVertical Fox was founded with a vision to create a transparent process to procure and manage employee benefits, better, faster and more cost effectively than ever before. The industry’s current antiquated, often manual, one-off processes are incredibly inefficient and waste billions of dollars. In addition, the lack of automated real time decision making tools often forces employers to rely on the anecdotal experience and opinions of a single consultant. \n\nThe new Vertical Fox paradigm provides complete transparency to insurers, consultants and employers. The firm’s cloud based dashboard lowers operational costs for brokers and allows them to provide real time data to CFO’s and human resource executives giving them an entirely new client experience with faster results and more powerful insights.\n\nEach Vertical Fox co-founder brings nearly 25 years’ experience managing and running benefits consulting firms, participating on insurance carrier advisory boards and working closely with employers. This experience has enabled the Vertical Fox leadership team to develop and provide solutions to overcome critical deficiencies that have never been addressed within the benefits industry. \n    755 New York Ave,  Huntington, New York 11743, US",

Leveraging decades of deep research from Stanford SLAC’s theoretical physics group, Quantum’s Dynamic Quantum Clustering (DQC) finds meaning in data without starting hypotheses or assumptions.  It is a revolutionary tool for exploring complex biological data, where the scope and breadth of data makes the initial step of hypothesis generation a problem of its own.\n\nWe are VC funded and passionate about uncovering the hidden relationships between biomarkers and diseases.

It is a real-time, online learning platform that allows the classes to be conducted online using patent-pending technology which removes the notion that teaching can only be done in closed classrooms. It has all the features and tools a teacher would need in today’s teaching methodology to run an engaging classroom, including interactive whiteboard, audio and video support, active student participation, direct and group interaction, directed and taught coursework options, examinations and testing options, grading and much more. Edusity is the only true online learning platform that allows for an active participation from the parents by allowing them to check how their child is doing in the classroom real-time and monitor their progress. Unlike the number of DIY (Do-it-yourself) platforms available, Edusity brings the closed classroom environment online through real-time teaching.\n\nEdusity is available on a SaaS model where teachers can sign up and put their courses online, use our exclusive technology platform and take in a lion’s share of their course fees. In this model, we bring the students to the teachers and promote their courses through our unique online branding initiatives. Edusity also uses an unique teacher grading system which takes student and parent feedback and teacher experience into account to determine the teacher’s compensation. Edusity is also available in a complete white-labelled solution to fit in the needs of schools, universities and training institutes that want to keep their brand but want to bring their courses online. In this world of pandemics and high overheads, Edusity provides an ideal platform to move away from tradition, limitations and boundaries and embrace the world of unlimited opportunities in the online education space using the technology of the future.  \n    103-5770 Hurontario St,  Mississauga, Ontario L5R 3G5, CA",

In 2004, Christian Prince, Acclimate founder and CTO, knew there had to be a better way for businesses to share supply chain data, harness the power of the information being transmitted, and unleash the monumental impact it would have on business performance. So he combined his technological savvy with his in-depth supply chain knowledge to give birth to a revolution.\r\n\r\nHis vision was to create better EDI solutions and services that would allow businesses to access and use supply chain transaction data more effectively than ever before. Today, Acclimate has evolved to go well beyond standard EDI and is the pioneer in converting real-time EDI data into useful business information at each link in the supply chain.\r\n\r\nAt Acclimate, our strength is our experience. With a proven track record of supporting some of the most complicated and demanding supply chains in North America, Acclimate has a wide base of satisfied customers.\r\n\r\nToday, our vision is simple: Do data right the first time.\r\n\r\nWe are creating some of the best supply chain solutions, building strong, flexible supply chain networks, and offering solid data integrity. Our goal is to provide unparalleled domain knowledge, technical expertise, and customer support.\r\n\r\nThat’s the Power of Once.

  "description": "We’ve created Homeis because we know first hand how deep the experience of being foreign-born is. When you ask us what home is, we don’t have an easy answer. It’s complicated. We have the city we chose to live in and call home, and then we have our culture, the country we come from, which we call home as well. And it’s a big part of our identity, it’s who we are.\n\nHomeis was created to help people like us, who belong here and there, and feel that the Internet is undeserving them. We’ve witnessed how difficult it is for local foreign-born communities to digitally connect, share their culture, their local knowledge, and unique context. We saw how important these communities are in one’s life, how supportive they can be, and how effective their common wisdom can be to its members.\n\nSo we decided it’s time to give foreign-born communities a dedicated comprehensive product. A product that understands them really well, and most importantly - empowers them. It’s what we’re here for. While local culture networks have always existed, our mission is to use technology and innovation to turn these invisible groups into visible communities.\n\nHomeis was founded in Feb 2017 in NYC and Tel Aviv. We’ve launched our first community in Dec 2017. We currently have Indian, Israeli, French, African and Mexican communities- and many more to come! As most foreign-born people, we are BIG dreamers. Join us!\n      Tel Aviv, Center 6713521, IL",

Our mission to bring clarity to private company financial data is rooted in data. Lots of data. With over 1.2 million US-based private company financials—crossing 2600 industries—our database is the largest of its kind, in fact. \n\nOur database was initially born out of a of a partnership with the Ewing Marion Kauffman Foundation and the University of Wisconsin in 2000 and was largely used for economic development agencies, universities, and research.  Over the last 18 years, the data has been extensively manicured and independently verified as recently as fall of 2017 to prepare the data for rigorous statistical research. \n\nWhile the data’s roots are steeped in academia, in 2016 CxO Analytics was formed to focus on bringing the research, knowledge and insight of that data to the business world. Using the data itself, academic experts developed various proprietary analytics to streamline how businesses can confidently make financial management decisions and leverage predictive modeling to push their business performance to the top of their sector. \n\nCxO Analytics is a privately owned company—just like its users—and operates out of Atlanta, Georgia.  \n    1707 Ashebark Ln NE,  Marietta, Georgia 30068, US",
