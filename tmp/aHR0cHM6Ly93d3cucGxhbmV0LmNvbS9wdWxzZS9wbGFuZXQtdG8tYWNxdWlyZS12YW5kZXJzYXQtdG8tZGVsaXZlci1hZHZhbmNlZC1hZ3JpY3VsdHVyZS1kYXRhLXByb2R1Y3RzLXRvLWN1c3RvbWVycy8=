Vandersat&rsquo;s innovative products help customers better measure and understand water management and crop health in major markets. Planet intends to leverage VanderSat&rsquo;s technologies and products in further pursuit of bringing to market next-generation solutions that combine the best of commercial and public satellite data to provide clear and actionable information to help industries, non-profits, and governments around the world.</p>\n<p>VanderSat has world-class expertise in providing insights to customers by drawing from NASA, ESA and JAXA satellite data, and has built a suite of novel products that report on key conditions on the Earth&rsquo;s surface, like soil moisture, land surface temperature, vegetation optical depth, and biomass. VanderSat&rsquo;s unique algorithms deliver daily, global data products with great accuracy, unhindered by changing cloud-cover and atmospheric conditions.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;VanderSat is a mission-driven company with the goal to serve one billion hectares of land in 2024.

And when one combines their new data with Planet&rsquo;s, the value is far greater than the sum of its parts,&rdquo; said Will Marshall, CEO and Co-Founder of Planet. &ldquo;We believe VanderSat&rsquo;s products will add value in Planet&rsquo;s core verticals of agriculture, and civil government, and will help us open up to others such as insurance and banking, to help grow our business.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>At Planet, one of our goals is to bridge the gap between real-world problems and the complexity of remote-sensing science. VanderSat is another step towards that goal with their advanced analytics.

For example, easier-to-consume data can enable modeling to help financial institutions and insurers quantify climate impacts on water availability and crop production.</p>\n<p>Adding VanderSat&rsquo;s unique, all-weather data products to Planet&rsquo;s high-cadence and high-resolution global monitoring will bring even greater value to users in agriculture, civil government and insurance by providing them with richer insights and more precise measurements.
